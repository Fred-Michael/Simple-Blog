# Simple-Blog
A simple blog that works with json-server as the make-do backend (API) and jQuery for fetching data.
As a registered user, you can Create and View Blog posts and make comments on a particular blog post.

N.B. Only the Admin (details in the db.json file) can perform Create-Delete-Update operations.
Regular users can only view, login and comment on a blog post.
